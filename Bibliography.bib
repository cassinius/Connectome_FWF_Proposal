abstract = {SpikeNET is a simulator for modeling large networks of asynchronously spiking neurons. It uses simple integrate-and-fire neurons which undergo step-like changes in membrane potential when synaptic inputs arrive. If a threshold is exceeded, the potential is reset and the neuron added to a list to be propagated on the next time step. Using such spike lists greatly reduces the computations associated with large networks, and simplifies implementations using parallel hardware since inter-processor communication can be limited to sending lists of the neurons which just fired. We have used it to model complex multilayer architectures based on the primate visual system that involve millions of neurons and billions of synaptic connections. Such models are not only biological but also efficient, robust and very fast, qualities which they share with the human visual system.},

However, large-scale models are expensive to simulate due to the number and interconnectedness of neurons in the brain. Furthermore, where such simulations are used in an embodied setting, the simulation must be real-time in order to be useful. In this paper we present NeMo, a platform for such simulations which achieves high performance through the use of highly parallel commodity hardware in the form of graphics processing units (GPUs). NeMo makes use of the Izhikevich neuron model which provides a range of realistic spiking dynamics while being computationally efficient. Our GPU kernel can deliver up to 400 million spikes per second. This corresponds to a real-time simulation of around 40 000 neurons under biologically plausible conditions with 1000 synapses per neuron and a mean firing rate of 10 Hz.},

abstract = {Increased efforts in the assembly and analysis of connectome data are providing new insights into the principles underlying the connectivity of neural circuits. However, despite these considerable advances in connectomics, neuroanatomical data must be integrated with neurophysiological and behavioral data in order to obtain a complete picture of neural function. Due to its nearly complete wiring diagram and large behavioral repertoire, the nematode worm Caenorhaditis elegans is an ideal organism in which to explore in detail this link between neural connectivity and behavior. In this paper, we develop a neuroanatomically-grounded model of salt klinotaxis, a form of chemotaxis in which changes in orientation are directed towards the source through gradual continual adjustments. We identify a minimal klinotaxis circuit by systematically searching the C. elegans connectome for pathways linking chemosensory neurons to neck motor neurons, and prune the resulting network based on both experimental considerations and several simplifying assumptions. We then use an evolutionary algorithm to find possible values for the unknown electrophsyiological parameters in the network such that the behavioral performance of the entire model is optimized to match that of the animal. Multiple runs of the evolutionary algorithm produce an ensemble of such models. We analyze in some detail the mechanisms by which one of the best evolved circuits operates and characterize the similarities and differences between this mechanism and other solutions in the ensemble. Finally, we propose a series of experiments to determine which of these alternatives the worm may be using.},

abstract = {Understanding how information about external stimuli is transformed into behavior is one of the central goals of neuroscience. Here we characterize the information flow through a complete sensorimotor circuit: from stimulus, to sensory neurons, to interneurons, to motor neurons, to muscles, to motion. Specifically, we apply a recently developed framework for quantifying information flow to a previously published ensemble of models of salt klinotaxis in the nematode worm Caenorhabditis elegans. Despite large variations in the neural parameters of individual circuits, we found that the overall information flow architecture circuit is remarkably consistent across the ensemble. This suggests structural connectivity is not necessarily predictive of effective connectivity. It also suggests information flow analysis captures general principles of operation for the klinotaxis circuit. In addition, information flow analysis reveals several key principles underlying how the models operate: (1) Interneuron class AIY is responsible for integrating information about positive and negative changes in concentration, and exhibits a strong left/right information asymmetry. (2) Gap junctions play a crucial role in the transfer of information responsible for the information symmetry observed in interneuron class AIZ. (3) Neck motor neuron class SMB implements an information gating mechanism that underlies the circuit's state-dependent response. (4) The neck carries more information about small changes in concentration than about large ones, and more information about positive changes in concentration than about negative ones. Thus, not all directions of movement are equally informative for the worm. Each of these findings corresponds to hypotheses that could potentially be tested in the worm. Knowing the results of these experiments would greatly refine our understanding of the neural circuit underlying klinotaxis.},

This systematic and standardized approach allows spatial registration of individual experiments into a common three dimensional (3D) reference space, resulting in a whole-brain connectivity matrix. A computational model yields insights into connectional strength distribution, symmetry and other network properties. Virtual tractography illustrates 3D topography among interconnected regions.

abstract = {Objective: Living organisms have mechanisms to adapt to various conditions of external environments. If we can realize these mechanisms on the computer, it may be possible to apply methods of biological and biomimetic adaptation to the engineering of artificial machines. This paper focuses on the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans), which has a relatively simple structure and is one of the most studied multicellular organisms. We aim to develop its computer model, artificial C. elegans, to analyze control mechanisms with respect to motion. Although C. elegans processes many kinds of external stimuli, we focused on gentle touch stimulation. Methods: The proposed model consists of a neuronal circuit model for motor control that responds to gentle touch stimuli and a kinematic model of the body for movement. All parameters included in the neuronal circuit model are adjusted by using the real-coded genetic algorithm. Also, the neuronal oscillator model is employed in the body model to generate the sinusoidal movement. The motion velocity of the body model is controlled by the neuronal circuit model so as to correspond to the touch stimuli that are received in sensory neurons. Conclusion: The computer simulations confirmed that the proposed model is capable of realizing motor control similar to that of the actual organism qualitatively. By using the artificial organism it may be possible to clarify or predict some characteristics that cannot be measured in actual experiments. With the recent development of computer technology, such a computational analysis becomes a real possibility. The artificial C. elegans will contribute for studies in experimental biology in future, although it is still developing at present. ?? 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {There is increasing interest in topological analysis of brain networks as complex systems, with researchers often using neuroimaging to represent the large-scale organization of nervous systems without precise cellular resolution. Here we used graph theory to investigate the neuronal connectome of the nematode worm Caenorhabditis elegans, which is defined anatomically at a cellular scale as 2287 synaptic connections between 279 neurons. We identified a small number of highly connected neurons as a rich club (N = 11) interconnected with high efficiency and high connection distance. Rich club neurons comprise almost exclusively the interneurons of the locomotor circuits, with known functional importance for coordinated movement. The rich club neurons are connector hubs, with high betweenness centrality, and many intermodular connections to nodes in different modules. On identifying the shortest topological paths (motifs) between pairs of peripheral neurons, the motifs that are found most frequently traverse the rich club. The rich club neurons are born early in development, before visible movement of the animal and before the main phase of developmental elongation of its body. We conclude that the high wiring cost of the globally integrative rich club of neurons in the C. elegans connectome is justified by the adaptive value of coordinated movement of the animal. The economical trade-off between physical cost and behavioral value of rich club organization in a cellular connectome confirms theoretical expectations and recapitulates comparable results from human neuroimaging on much larger scale networks, suggesting that this may be a general and scale-invariant principle of brain network organization.},

Recent studies have shown that human connectomes can be constructed using various neuroimaging technologies and further characterized using sophisticated analytic strategies, such as graph theory. These methods reveal the intriguing topological architectures of human brain networks in healthy populations and explore the changes throughout normal development and aging and under various pathological conditions. However, given the huge complexity of this methodology, toolboxes for graph-based network visualization are still lacking. Here, using MATLAB with a graphical user interface (GUI), we developed a graph-theoretical network visualization toolbox, called BrainNet Viewer, to illustrate human connectomes as ball-and-stick models. Within this toolbox, several combinations of defined files with connectome information can be loaded to display different combinations of brain surface, nodes and edges. In addition, display properties, such as the color and size of network elements or the layout of the figure, can be adjusted within a comprehensive but easy-to-use settings panel. Moreover, BrainNet Viewer draws the brain surface, nodes and edges in sequence and displays brain networks in multiple views, as required by the user. The figure can be manipulated with certain interaction functions to display more detailed information. Furthermore, the figures can be exported as commonly used image file formats or demonstration video for further use. BrainNet Viewer helps researchers to visualize brain networks in an easy, flexible and quick manner, and this software is freely available on the NITRC website (www.nitrc.org/projects/bnv/).},

abstract = {Neurons are the fundamental structural units of the nervous system—i.e., the Neuron Doctrine—as the pioneering work of Santiago Ramón y Cajal in the 1880's clearly demonstrated through careful observation of Golgi-stained neuronal morphologies. However, at that time sample preparation, imaging methods and computational tools were either nonexistent or insufficiently developed to permit the precise mapping of an entire brain with all of its neurons and their connections. Some measure of the “mesoscopic” connectional organization of the mammalian brain has been obtained over the past decade by alignment of sparse subsets of labeled neurons onto a reference atlas or via MRI-based diffusion tensor imaging. Neither method, however, provides data on the complete connectivity of all neurons comprising an individual brain. Fortunately, whole-brain cellular connectomics now appears within reach due to recent advances in whole-brain sample preparation and high-throughput electron microscopy (EM), though substantial obstacles remain with respect to large volume electron microscopic acquisitions and automated neurite reconstructions. This perspective examines the current status and problems associated with generating a mammalian whole-brain cellular connectome and argues that the time is right to launch a concerted connectomic attack on a small mammalian whole-brain.},

abstract = {Advanced neuroinformatics tools are required for methods of connectome mapping, analysis, and visualization. The inherent multi-modality of connectome datasets poses new challenges for data organization, integration, and sharing. We have designed and implemented the Connectome Viewer Toolkit - a set of free and extensible open source neuroimaging tools written in Python. The key components of the toolkit are as follows: (1) The Connectome File Format is an XML-based container format to standardize multi-modal data integration and structured metadata annotation. (2) The Connectome File Format Library enables management and sharing of connectome files. (3) The Connectome Viewer is an integrated research and development environment for visualization and analysis of multi-modal connectome data. The Connectome Viewer's plugin architecture supports extensions with network analysis packages and an interactive scripting shell, to enable easy development and community contributions. Integration with tools from the scientific Python community allows the leveraging of numerous existing libraries for powerful connectome data mining, exploration, and comparison. We demonstrate the applicability of the Connectome Viewer Toolkit using Diffusion MRI datasets processed by the Connectome Mapper. The Connectome Viewer Toolkit is available from http://www.cmtk.org/},

abstract = {A male pronucleus migrates toward the center of an egg to reach the female pronucleus for zygote formation. This migration depends on microtubules growing from two centrosomes associated with the male pronucleus. Two mechanisms were previously proposed for this migration: a "pushing mechanism," which uses the pushing force resulting from microtubule polymerization, and a "pulling mechanism," which uses the length-dependent pulling force generated by minus-end-directed motors anchored throughout the cytoplasm. We combined two computer-assisted analyses to examine the relative contribution of these mechanisms to male pronuclear migration. Computer simulation revealed an intrinsic difference in migration behavior of the male pronucleus between the pushing and pulling mechanisms. In vivo measurements using image processing showed that the actual migration behavior in Caenorhabditis elegans confirms the pulling mechanism. A male pronucleus having a single centrosome migrated toward the single aster. We propose that the pulling mechanism is the primary mechanism for male pronuclear migration.

   abstract = {Medical information systems are already highly sophisticated; however, while computer performance has increased exponentially, human cognitive evolution cannot advance at the same speed. Consequently, the focus on interaction and communication between humans and computers is of increasing importance in medicine and healthcare. The daily actions of medical professionals must be the central concern of any innovation. Simply surrounding and supporting them with new and emerging technologies is not sufficient if these increase rather than decrease the workload. Information systems are a central component of modern knowledge-based medicine and health services; therefore, it is necessary for knowledge management to continually be adapted to the needs and demands of medical professionals within this environment of steadily increasing high-tech medicine. Information processing, in particular its potential effectiveness in modern health services and the optimization ofprocesses and operational sequences, is also of increasing interest. It is particularly important for medical information systems (e.g., hospital information systems and decision support systems) to be designed with the daily schedules, responsibilities and exigencies of the medical professionals in mind. Within the context of this symposium our end users are medical professionals and justifiably expect the software technology to provide a clear benefit: to support them efficiently and effectively in their daily activities. In biomedicine, healthcare, clinical medicine and the life sciences, professional end users are confronted with an increased mass of data. Research in human-computer interaction (HCI) and information retrieval (IR) or knowledge discovery in databases and data mining (KDD) has long been working to develop methods that help users to identify, extract, visualize and understand useful information from these masses of high-dimensional and mostly weakly structured data. HCI and IR/KDD, however, take very different perspectives in tackling this challenge; and historically, they have had little collaboration. Our goal is to combine these efforts to support professionals in interactively analyzing information properties and visualizing the relevant information without becoming overwhelmed. The challenge is to bring HCI and IR/KDD researchers to work together and hence reap the benefits that computer science/informatics can provide to the areas of medicine, healthcare and the life sciences },

abstract = {Computer modeling is becoming an increasingly valuable tool in the study of the complex interactions underlying the behavior of the brain. Software applications have been developed which make it easier to create models of neural networks as well as detailed models which replicate the electrical activity of individual neurons. The code formats used by each of these applications are generally incompatible however, making it difficult to exchange models and ideas between researchers. Here we present the structure of a neuronal model description language, NeuroML. This provides a way to express these complex models in a common format based on the underlying physiology, allowing them to be mapped to multiple applications. We have tested this language by converting published neuronal models to NeuroML format and comparing their behavior on a number of commonly used simulators. Creating a common, accessible model description format will expose more of the model details to the wider neuroscience community, thus increasing their quality and reliability, as for other Open Source software. NeuroML will also allow a greater “ecosystem” of tools to be developed for building, simulating and analyzing these complex neuronal systems.},

@article{Ogg1997,
abstract = {In mammals, insulin signalling regulates glucose transport together with the expression and activity of various metabolic enzymes. In the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, a related pathway regulates metabolism, development and longevity. Wild-type animals enter the developmentally arrested dauer stage in response to high levels of a secreted pheromone, accumulating large amounts of fat in their intestines and hypodermis. Mutants in DAF-2 (a homologue of the mammalian insulin receptor) and AGE-1 (a homologue of the catalytic subunit of mammalian phosphatidylinositol 3-OH kinase) arrest development at the dauer stage. Moreover, animals bearing weak or temperature-sensitive mutations in daf-2 and age-1 can develop reproductively, but nevertheless show increased energy storage and longevity. Here we show that null mutations in daf-16 suppress the effects of mutations in daf-2 or age-1; lack of daf-16 bypasses the need for this insulin receptor-like signalling pathway. The principal role of DAF-2/AGE-1 signalling is thus to antagonize DAF-16. daf-16 is widely expressed and encodes three members of the Fork head family of transcription factors. The DAF-2 pathway acts synergistically with the pathway activated by a nematode TGF-beta-type signal, DAF-7, suggesting that DAF-16 cooperates with nematode SMAD proteins in regulating the transcription of key metabolic and developmental control genes. The probable human orthologues of DAF-16, FKHR and AFX, may also act downstream of insulin signalling and cooperate with TGF-beta effectors in mediating metabolic regulation. These genes may be dysregulated in diabetes.},

The availability of novel tools in molecular neurogenetics and increasingly sophisticated neuroimaging technologies, together with the revitalization of MS neuropathology, has created a new paradigm for the multidisciplinary study of this disease. This is reflected by the growing resolution of the MS genomic map, discovery of delicate inflammatory networks that are perturbed in MS, identification of mediators of demyelination, and recognition that cumulative axonal loss and neuronal injury are the histological correlates of neurological disability. Together, these advances have set the stage for the development of therapeutic approaches designed to target the demyelinating and neurodegenerative components of the disease and promote repair. ?? 2006 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = "Using a laser microbeam to kill specific subsets of the pharyngeal nervous system of C. elegans, we found that feeding was accomplished by two separately controlled muscle motions, isthmus peristalsis and pumping. The single neuron \{M4\} was necessary and sufficient for isthmus peristalsis. The \{MC\} neurons were necessary for normal stimulation of pumping in response to food, but pumping continued and was functional in MC- worms. The remaining 12 neuron types were also unnecessary for functional pumping. No operation we did, including destruction of the entire pharyngeal nervous system, abolished pumping altogether. When we killed all pharyngeal neurons except M4, the worms were viable and fertile, although retarded and starved. Since feeding is one of the few known essential actions controlled by the nervous system, we suggest that most of the C. elegans nervous system is dispensable in hermaphrodites under laboratory conditions. This may explain the ease with which nervous system mutants are isolated and handled in C. elegans. "

Here we develop a semi-automated pipeline using electron microscopy to reconstruct a connectome, containing 379 neurons and 8,637 chemical synaptic contacts, within the Drosophila optic medulla. By matching reconstructed neurons to examples from light microscopy, we assigned neurons to cell types and assembled a connectome of the repeating module of the medulla. Within this module, we identified cell types constituting a motion detection circuit, and showed that the connections onto individual motion-sensitive neurons in this circuit were consistent with their direction selectivity. Our results identify cellular targets for future functional investigations, and demonstrate that connectomes can provide key insights into neuronal computations.},
