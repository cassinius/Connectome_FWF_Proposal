@article{Ip2011ResilienceTransportationNetworks,
abstract = {To analyze the resilience of transportation networks, it is proposed to use a quantifiable resilience evaluation approach. First, we represent transportation networks by an undirected graph with the nodes as cities and edges as traffic roads. Because the survivability of transportation of a pair of cities depends on the number of passageways between them, the resilience of a city node can be evaluated by the weighted average number of reliable passageways with all other city nodes in the network. The network resilience can then be calculated by the weighted sum of the resilience of all nodes. To identify critical road lines or hub cities in networks, the concept of friability is proposed. This is defined as the reduction in total resilience upon removing an edge or hub city. Following the resilience and friability evaluation, a structure optimization model with a computational algorithm for transportation network design is recommended. Based on the recommended approaches, the resilience and friability of the railway network within the Chinese mainland is evaluated and analyzed. Several interesting conclusions are drawn from the computational results. The friability value of the railway lines in the Sichuan Basin which was damaged by the recent earthquake in China was also calculated.},

@article{Ying2008RandomizingSocialNetworks,
abstract = {Understanding the general properties of real social networks has gained much attention due to the proliferation of networked data. The nodes in the network are the individuals and the links among them denote their relationships. Many applications of networks such as anonymous Web browsing require relationship anonymity due to the sensitive, stigmatizing, or confidential nature of the re- lationship. One general approach for this problem is to randomize the edges in true networks, and only disclose the randomized net- works. In this paper, we investigate how various properties of net- works may be affected due to randomization. Specifically, we focus on the spectrum since the eigenvalues of a network are intimately connected to many important topological features. We also con- duct theoretical analysis on the extent to which edge anonymity can be achieved. A spectrum preserving graph randomization method, which can better preserve network properties while protecting edge anonymity, is then presented and empirically evaluated.},

@article{Kirsch2006LessHashing,
abstract = {A standard technique from the hashing literature is to use two hash functions h1(x) and h2(x) to simulate additional hash functions of the form gi(x) = h1(x) + ih2(x). We demonstrate that this technique can be usefully applied to Bloom filters and related data structures. Specifically, only two hash functions are necessary to effectively implement a Bloom filter without any loss in the asymptotic false positive probability. This leads to less computation and potentially less need for randomness in practice.},

@article{Loguinov2005Peer2PeerResilience,
abstract = { This paper examines graph-theoretic properties of existing peer-to-peer networks and proposes a new infrastructure based on optimal-diameter de Bruijn graphs. Since generalized de Bruijn graphs exhibit very short average distances and high resilience to node failure, they are well suited for distributed hash tables (DHTs). Using the example of Chord, CAN, and de Bruijn, we study the routing performance, graph expansion, clustering properties, and bisection width of each graph. Having confirmed that de Bruijn graphs offer the best diameter and highest connectivity among the existing peer-to-peer structures, we offer a very simple incremental building process that preserves optimal properties of de Bruijn graphs under uniform user joins/departures. We call the combined peer-to-peer architecture optimal diameter routing infrastructure.},

@article{Peters2013BrainFunctionalNetworks,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Graph theory has been recently introduced to characterize complex brain networks, making it highly suitable to investigate altered connectivity in neurologic disorders. A current model proposes autism spectrum disorder (ASD) as a developmental disconnection syndrome, supported by converging evidence in both non-syndromic and syndromic ASD. However, the effects of abnormal connectivity on network properties have not been well studied, particularly in syndromic ASD. To close this gap, brain functional networks of electroencephalographic (EEG) connectivity were studied through graph measures in patients with Tuberous Sclerosis Complex (TSC), a disorder with a high prevalence of ASD, as well as in patients with non-syndromic ASD.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: EEG data were collected from TSC patients with ASD (n = 14) and without ASD (n = 29), from patients with non-syndromic ASD (n = 16), and from controls (n = 46). First, EEG connectivity was characterized by the mean coherence, the ratio of inter- over intra-hemispheric coherence and the ratio of long- over short-range coherence. Next, graph measures of the functional networks were computed and a resilience analysis was conducted. To distinguish effects related to ASD from those related to TSC, a two-way analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) was applied, using age as a covariate.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Analysis of network properties revealed differences specific to TSC and ASD, and these differences were very consistent across subgroups. In TSC, both with and without a concurrent diagnosis of ASD, mean coherence, global efficiency, and clustering coefficient were decreased and the average path length was increased. These findings indicate an altered network topology. In ASD, both with and without a concurrent diagnosis of TSC, decreased long- over short-range coherence and markedly increased network resilience were found.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: The altered network topology in TSC represents a functional correlate of structural abnormalities and may play a role in the pathogenesis of neurological deficits. The increased resilience in ASD may reflect an excessively degenerate network with local overconnection and decreased functional specialization. This joint study of TSC and ASD networks provides a unique window to common neurobiological mechanisms in autism.},
